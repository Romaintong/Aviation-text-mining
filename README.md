## Project Description

This project aims to analyze emotional content in text data and identify topics using LDA modeling. It includes various modules for text processing, sentiment analysis, and visualization of results.

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Processing:**
   Run `data_process.py` to process and prepare the data.

2. **Emotion Analysis:**
   Use `emotion_analyze.py` and `emotion_calculator.py` for sentiment analysis.

3. **LDA Topic Modeling:**
   Run `conduct_lda_model.py` to perform LDA topic modeling.

4. **Visualization:**
   Use `emotion_grained_research_result.py` to generate visualizations of emotional trends.
